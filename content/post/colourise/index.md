## Introduction

On **December 17, 2025**, I proudly **defended my MSc thesis**:

**"Advanced Machine Learning Techniques and Explainable AI for Financial Fraud Detection"**  
at the **Warsaw University of Technology, Poland**.

This thesis focused on developing **robust, interpretable, and reproducible ML pipelines** to detect and prevent financial fraud. It emphasized **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques such as **SHAP** and **LIME** to provide actionable insights for decision-makers. The work addressed real-world challenges, including **highly imbalanced datasets**, noisy financial records, and complex sequential patterns.

## Thesis Highlights

- Designed **end-to-end ML pipelines** for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability.
- Applied **SHAP and LIME** for transparent, interpretable model predictions.
- Ensured **robustness, reproducibility, and reliability** for real-world financial applications.
- Delivered **actionable insights** to improve auditing, decision-making, and fraud mitigation.

## Defense & Graduation

The defense included:

1. A **comprehensive presentation** of methodology, results, and insights to faculty and peers.
2. A live **demonstration of ML pipelines and explainable predictions**.
3. In-depth discussions on **ethical AI, fairness, and practical deployment considerations**.

I am honored to have graduated with **Excellent Rank (highest grade)**, reflecting both my **academic excellence** and the **impact of my research**.

## Reflections

- The MSc journey strengthened my **expertise in Graph Neural Networks, NLP, LLMs, and predictive modeling**.
- It reinforced the importance of **robust evaluation, reproducibility, and explainability** in AI systems.
- Excited to apply these skills to **AI-driven research, industry projects, and socially impactful solutions**.
