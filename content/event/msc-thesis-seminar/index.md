title: "Advanced Machine Learning Methods for Fraud Detection"
event: "MSc Research Seminar"
location: "Warsaw University of Technology, Poland"
summary: "Research seminar discussing classical and modern machine learning approaches for financial fraud detection."

abstract: |
  This seminar presents an overview of advanced machine learning methods for financial fraud detection,
  drawing on established literature and reference materials formatted in a Springer-style structure.
  The presentation focuses on modeling challenges such as class imbalance, feature engineering, and evaluation strategies.

  **Important:** This seminar is distinct from the author's MSc thesis work.
  The MSc research titled *“Advanced Machine Learning and Explainable AI for Financial Fraud Detection”*
  represents a substantially extended, improved, and ongoing research effort, with additional
  methodological depth, interpretability analysis, and robustness evaluation intended for publication.
