abstract: |-
  This project analyzes hate speech trends in Tigrinya social media posts collected between 2018 and 2022, 
  during the Northern Ethiopia Tigray conflict. It combines machine learning, exploratory data analysis, 
  and data-driven approaches to identify temporal and spatial patterns of harmful speech.

  Key highlights:
  - Developed ML-based text classification models to detect hate speech in a low-resource language.
  - Analyzed temporal trends and mapped geographic propagation of harmful content.
  - Provided actionable insights for conflict-sensitive content moderation and interventions.

summary: "Research project on hate speech detection and trend analysis in Tigrinya social media."
