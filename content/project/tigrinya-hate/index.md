## Overview
This project analyzes **hate speech trends** in Tigrinya social media posts collected between **2018 and 2022**, during the **Northern Ethiopia Tigray conflict**. It combines **machine learning, exploratory data analysis, and data-driven approaches** to identify temporal and spatial patterns of harmful speech.

## Motivation
Tigrinya is a **low-resource language**, presenting unique challenges for automated content moderation and linguistic analysis. Understanding hate speech trends is crucial during periods of **political instability and armed conflict** for research, humanitarian, and policy applications.

## Methods & Work
- Collected and preprocessed Tigrinya social media data
- Developed ML-based **text classification models** to detect hate speech
- Applied **temporal analysis** to study frequency and severity trends
- Examined **content length characteristics** and moderation actions
- Mapped **geographic propagation** of hate-related content
- Evaluated correlations between **conflict events** and spikes in hate speech

## Results & Insights
- Identified **hotspots** where hate speech was most actively disseminated
- Found strong **temporal correlations** with conflict escalation
- Provided evidence for the need of **tailored ML solutions** for low-resource languages
- Developed actionable insights for **conflict-sensitive content moderation**

## Applications
- Automated hate speech detection in low-resource languages
- Monitoring of social media during conflicts
- Supporting NGOs, governments, and researchers with targeted interventions
