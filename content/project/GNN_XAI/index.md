## Overview
This research project focuses on predicting molecular properties using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, where molecules are modeled as graphs with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges.

The goal is to develop **accurate, interpretable, and robust models** suitable for scientific and industrial applications.

## Methods
- Implemented GNN architectures using **PyTorch Geometric**
- Designed node- and edge-level representations for molecular graphs
- Addressed noisy and imbalanced datasets through careful preprocessing
- Built **reproducible evaluation pipelines** with cross-validation

## Explainability
- Applied **GNNExplainer** to interpret predictions at:
  - node-level (important atoms)
  - edge-level (critical bonds)
- Conducted feature- and structure-level analyses for explainable predictions

## Results
- Achieved strong predictive performance across molecular property benchmarks
- Improved interpretability without sacrificing accuracy
- Enabled model inspection suitable for research and decision support

## Status
📄 Ongoing research project — publication in preparation.
