## Overview
This MSc thesis project focuses on **detecting financial fraud** using **advanced machine learning techniques** combined with **Explainable AI (XAI)**.  

Financial transactions are highly **complex, noisy, and imbalanced**, making fraud detection challenging. The project emphasizes **robust, interpretable, and reproducible ML pipelines** suitable for real-world deployment and regulatory compliance.

## Motivation
Fraudulent financial activities pose significant operational and regulatory risks. Traditional detection methods are often limited in **accuracy and interpretability**. This work addresses these gaps by:

- Developing **robust ML models** that handle highly imbalanced datasets.  
- Ensuring **explainable predictions** for auditability and decision support.  
- Delivering **actionable insights** to financial institutions.

## Methods & Work
- Built **end-to-end ML pipelines** including preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.  
- Applied **ensemble models, neural networks, and anomaly detection techniques** to maximize predictive performance.  
- Leveraged **SHAP and other XAI tools** for feature-level and instance-level interpretability.  
- Implemented **robust cross-validation** and uncertainty-aware evaluation to ensure generalization under realistic distribution shifts.  
- Emphasized **reproducibility**, logging, and version control to ensure consistent results.  

## Results & Contributions
- Achieved **high predictive accuracy** in detecting fraudulent transactions in imbalanced datasets.  
- Provided **interpretable explanations** for model decisions, improving trust and accountability.  
- Established a **reusable and scalable ML framework** for financial fraud detection.  
- Developed insights that can **inform policy, auditing, and operational decision-making**.  
- Work is currently **under preparation for publication**.

## Applications
- Automated fraud detection for banks and financial services.  
- Decision support for compliance and audit teams.  
- Scalable and interpretable pipelines for other predictive modeling challenges in finance and beyond.  

## Key Highlights
- MSc thesis **graded Excellent (highest rank)** at Warsaw University of Technology.  
- Emphasis on **robustness, reproducibility, and actionable insights**.  
- Integration of **advanced ML, explainability, and real-world financial context**.
