Lots of people have been complaining that Wordle has become much harder since the NY Times purchased the games and took control.

What is going on?!\nSo it seems that the NY Times have changed Wordle already, and maybe they have added back in some of the 10,000 or so other possible 5 letter words that weren\u0026rsquo;t on the original Wordle list, hence the feeling it is now more difficult as there are more obscure or less familiar words being used?\nAnyway, here are the screenshots from a device where I had the old one still open in a chrome tab and was able to verify this.

Summary Introduction There are many different higher level programming languages out there such as C/C++, Go and Java which are probably considered more general computing languages or system languages. There are more modern languages such as swift and kotlin which are very popular in app development. Then there are higher level languages such as python, where the focus is simplicity and ease of use to allow the user to easily convert an idea or algorithm into program code. There are also languages that have developed communities in specific fields such as R for data science. For many years scientific computing was dominated by Fortran and MATLAB. New languages are frequently added to the list and some slowly die off.\nThere are many more examples but what the long list of languages shows is that there is rarely a language that does everything well for the needs of a particular community. For example, python is easy to learn and can do almost anything, but the trade off here is that it is an interpreted language and this makes it slow in comparison to Java and C which are compiled. However, it\u0026rsquo;s ease of use has made it a star in recent years and the recent explosion in data science and AI has seen python\u0026rsquo;s popularity soar.\nIf you have come from a scientific or academic background, then you will probably have spent many years using MATLAB as it was (and still is) a staple of many science and engineering undergraduate courses. And once you learn something you tend to keep using it because of familiarity: the devil you know is better than the one you don\u0026rsquo;t!\nI fall into this last category, I learned of MATLAB as an undergraduate but couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand why we were being though something like this - who would ever need it?! Roll on a few years into my Ph.D. and the first thing I did most days after switching on my computer was to open MATLAB in preparation for the days work. I enjoyed using MATLAB as it made my life easier for reading big data files and doing all my calculations. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have managed without it really, but I always had a desire to find something that didn\u0026rsquo;t have a big price tag attached. Something similar and familiar feeling but free so that I could use at home or in a future career.\nI\u0026rsquo;d heard of this language called python that was like a cross between MATLAB and Perl and thought \u0026ldquo;This sounds good\u0026rdquo;, but I was nearing the end of my Ph.D. and the looming deadline meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to explore. Around the same time I also came across an announcement of a new language that sounded like my ideal language. Like MATLAB to use but as fast as C. Perfect. But it was new, and still under development. And my deadlines meant I soon forgot about it. Eventually I moved on to python and have been well served by it for many years now.\nBut I still long for more speed at times. Particularly as my data sets grow with passing time (much like my waistline really).\nMeet Julia This is where I want to introduce Julia, which is still young. Actually, looking at the date on the post, it\u0026rsquo;s 10 years exactly tomorrow! And that is a lot younger than python, which is approaching it\u0026rsquo;s 31st birthday very soon.\nThat early announcement sounded so intriguing to me, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t prepared to spend a lot of time learning about a language that had yet to mature and show that it would be around long-term. However, I must admit that I forgot about it for many years as python did such a good job of filling all the holes in my daily workflow.\nRecently I picked up an old computer and logged in looking for some old files and saw the icon on the desktop for Julia. It was time to look it up and see how it was doing. Had they fulfilled their initial greedy ambitions? Was it even still active?\nAs it turns out, Julia is alive and well, possibly even thriving as more and more people become aware of it. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to write a tutorial on the use of Julia as there are already plenty of those, and many of which are quite detailed. What I would like to do is just show a simple use case that highlights the power of Julia and why it\u0026rsquo;s worth your consideration.\nUse Case: Vector Normalisation Vector normalisation is possibly something that you would be doing frequently in scientific computing or some data processing. The most commonly encountered vector norm (often simply called \u0026ldquo;the norm\u0026rdquo; of a vector, or sometimes the magnitude of a vector)1 is the L2-norm, given by\n$$ \\left| x \\right| _{2} = \\left| x \\right| = \\sqrt{{x_{1}}^{2} + {x_{2}}^{2} + \u0026hellip; + {x_{n}}^{2}} $$\nThis is a relatively simple calculation but can have a significant impact on performance if this is being calculated for a large number of vectors, partly because of the repeated use of a square root.\nTest Environment These are the details of the system on which I will do some test.\nSystem Specification Operating System Windows 11 Processor Intel i9-9880H Memory 64GB MATLAB Version R2020a Update 5 Python Version Python 3.9.7 (default, Sep 16 2021, 16:59:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] Julia Version Version 1.7.2 (2022-02-06) MATLAB Implementation I\u0026rsquo;ll start with the implementation in MATLAB, although there is already a norm and vecnorm function available in MATLAB. However, It\u0026rsquo;s quite trivial to implement such a function in MATLAB (or any other language) using a simple for-loop to assign the result to some pre-allocated memory. A second function using a vectorised approach is also implemented and can be compared with the inbuilt vecnorm function. Performance is measured with the inbuilt timeit function2.\n% define simple L2norm function function norms = calc_norm_loop(vec_array) [m,n] = size(vec_array); norms = zeros(m); for i=1:m norms(i) = sqrt(sum(vec_array(i,:).^2)); end end % vectorised function norms = calc_norm(vec_array) norms = sqrt((sum(vec_array.^2, 2))); end A typical vector size of 50,000 3-component vectors is used for testing.\n% create test set of vectors vec_1 = rand(50000,3); f = @() calc_norm_loop(vec_1); % handle to function timeit(f) f2 = @() calc_norm(vec_1); % handle to function timeit(f2) f3 = @() vecnorm(vec_1, 2, 2); timeit(f3) % check results a = calc_norm_loop(vec_1); b = calc_norm(vec_1); c = vecnorm(vec_1, 2, 2); % output in s ans = 0.0153 % 15.3 ms ans = 6.2837e-04 % 0.6283 ms ans = 0.0021 % 2.1 ms It\u0026rsquo;s not really a huge surprise to see that the for-loop implementation is the slowest by a large margin, but what is more interesting is that the vectorised function is actually many times quicker than the inbuilt function (I\u0026rsquo;ve repeated this test many times and the result is repeatable). I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure why this is the case and it\u0026rsquo;s a little surprising to see an inbuilt function not fully optimised. It is possible it\u0026rsquo;s original purpose is for calculating the norm of vectors much longer than 3 elements and, as such, may not be optimised for my typical 3-component use case.\nPython Implementation Much like for MATLAB it\u0026rsquo;s quite trivial to implement such a function in native python with a for-loop but the numerical computing library NumPy provides a ready made solution for this3 in the Linear Algebra submodule and also provides the flexibility to calculate various other vector norms.\nBut if doing things in python quickly is something you want to do, you may also be interested in the Numba package. The Numba package allows the user to significantly increase the performance of their code by pre-compiling the functions using a Just-In-Time (jit) compiler that runs the first time a function is called. Once compiled, this function is then re-used, possibly offering significant performance gains for functions that are slow and called many times.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the implementation of both the native and Numba functions for calculating the L2-norm. The interesting thing here is probably how little needs to be done to jit a function with Numba4 and unlock huge performance gains. In this case, just one change is required - the addition of @njit() before the function. Super easy!!\nimport numpy as np import math from numba import njit #%% Test functions - L2 Norm # Native Python Implementation def native_norm(vects): norms = [] for vec in vects: norms.append(math.sqrt(vec[0]**2 + vec[1]**2 + vec[2]**2)) return norms # Numba Implementation @njit() def numba_norm(vects): norms = [] for vec in vects: norms.append(math.sqrt(vec[0]**2 + vec[1]**2 + vec[2]**2)) return norms As many operations are size dependent, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the perfplot package to helpfully run a benchmark suite of arrays of different sizes, from a single vector to a very large array of 3-component vectors.\nout = perfplot.bench( setup=lambda n: np.random.random([n,3]), # setup random nx3 array kernels=[ lambda a: native_norm(a), lambda a: np.linalg.norm(a, axis=1), lambda a: numba_norm(a), ], labels=[\u0026quot;Native\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NumPy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Numba\u0026quot;], n_range=[2**k for k in range(25)], xlabel=\u0026quot;Number of vectors [Nr.]\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;L2-norm Performance\u0026quot; ) out.show( time_unit=\u0026quot;us\u0026quot;, # set to one of (\u0026quot;auto\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;s\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ms\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;us\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;ns\u0026quot;) to force plot units ) This automates the whole process and creates a nice plot of the relative performance of the supplied function(s) which you can see in the figure below.\nPerformance of various computation methods for L2-norm calculation Note: The Numba function needs to be compiled before running the suite of benchmark tests or else the compilation time of the function is included. The function is compiled on first usage. Some interesting takeaways from the results are:\nThe native python implementation is the slowest (Not Surprising!) Numba is a powerful just-in-time compiler than can make your functions many times quicker. The jitted function is somewhere between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude quicker than the native python code. 50-100x faster for one line of code more! As the array size increase, the Numba and NumPy solutions converge to the same results suggesting the code is being compiled to the same machine code. NumPy is slower for the smaller array sizes due to the overhead related to the NumPy function such as various implementation options and error checking. This overhead is large for the small array sizes but disappears for arrays above about several thousand rows in this. This is worth bearing in mind if you will only be working on small datasets. Although, I\u0026rsquo;m using a specific package for my benchmarking, it\u0026rsquo;s really just automating the process of using timeit. You will get very similar results running the following code for each size of array but this is a little tedious.\nvects = np.random.random([100,3]) %timeit native_norms = native_norm(vects) 119 µs ± 1.61 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each) %timeit numpy_norms = np.linalg.norm(vects, axis=1) 6.72 µs ± 305 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each) %timeit numba_norms = numba_norm(vects) 1.96 µs ± 31.3 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each) A more representative size for my typical use case would be much larger and, as shown in the figure, the gap between the NumPy and Numba implementations has disappeared at this size.\nvects = np.random.random([50000,3]) %timeit native_norms = native_norm(vects) 59.5 ms ± 1.53 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) %timeit numpy_norms = np.linalg.norm(vects, axis=1) 920 µs ± 13.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each) %timeit numba_norms = numba_norm(vects) 841 µs ± 102 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each) Some interesting comparisons to the MATLAB results can be made with this set of figures for the larger test array size of 50,000 vectors. MATLAB\u0026rsquo;s for-loop is several times quicker than the native python loop, but both the NumPy and Numba implementations are quicker than vecnorm but slightly slower than the home-rolled vectorised function.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out that timeit returns the mean for python and the median for MATLAB. I\u0026rsquo;ve also noticed that the MATLAB timing results are much less consistent as it only runs a small number of tests (just 11 in this case I think), so I\u0026rsquo;ve seen results range from 550 µs to 1.2 ms, putting it back in the same performance bracket as python when averaging these results.\nJulia Implementation Using Julia is a bit like writing code for python or MATLAB and it can be executed from the Julia REPL or using scripts. Julia is in some sense acting a bit like Numba in that is is compiling all the code before execution to benefit from the performance gained from compiled code.\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m not yet aware of any perfplot equivalent for Julia just yet, it is relatively easy to measure the performance of any functions using the BenchmarkTools package. I\u0026rsquo;m also going to use the LinearAlgebra and LoopVectorization packages to explore other options.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written the equivalent Julia function to my MATLAB and native python functions from earlier but in a vectorised manner as this is how I would write a similar function using Numpy. Years of MATLAB/python exposure has \u0026ldquo;loops are bad\u0026rdquo; seared in my brain, but the results in the previous sections have demonstrated that is invariably the case in those languages.\nusing BenchmarkTools using LinearAlgebra using LoopVectorization vec_1 = rand(50000,3) function normalize_by_row(arr) sqrt.(sum(arr.^2, dims=2)) end @btime provides a similar output to timeit, but it also includes the amount of memory used and number of memory allocations in the function. Useful information for improving any function, however, it is returning the minimum execution time instead of the mean or median. A more \u0026lsquo;full-fat\u0026rsquo; option of @benchmark can also be used to get these metrics and other additional information.\njulia\u0026gt; @btime nrm = normalize_by_row($vec_1); 393.300 μs (10 allocations: 1.91 MiB) julia\u0026gt; @benchmark nrm = normalize_by_row($vec_1) BenchmarkTools.Trial: 7864 samples with 1 evaluation. Range (min … max): 378.100 μs … 7.246 ms ┊ GC (min … max): 0.00% … 61.97% Time (median): 454.300 μs ┊ GC (median): 0.00% Time (mean ± σ): 632.479 μs ± 628.993 μs ┊ GC (mean ± σ): 19.93% ± 17.28% ▇█▆▅▄▃▂▂▁▁▁ ▂ ██████████████▇▇▇▆▆▄▄▄▃▁▄▃▁▃▁▃▁▁▁▃▁▁▁▁▁▄▄▄▅▅▅▅▇▇▇▇▇█▇▇▆▇▇▆▆▆▅ █ 378 μs Histogram: log(frequency) by time 3.76 ms \u0026lt; Memory estimate: 1.91 MiB, allocs estimate: 10. From this output we can see that our Julia function completes this operation on 50,000 3-component vectors over 7800 times with a median time of 454 μs and a mean time of 632 μs. We can also see that our function is using about 2MB of memory to carry out this process.\nSo how did our MATLAB and python code perform for the same size array? Well if you remember, both were woefully slow in the for-loop but using the vectorised approach both were in the region of 800-900 μs. Straight out of the box Julia outperforms both by a noticeable margin (20% or more) with little thought and zero optimisation required. I\u0026rsquo;m already beginning to see a case for switching to using Julia\u0026hellip;\nBut what about my initial Julia code? Can it be optimised like we did for MATLAB and python? What about all those memory allocations - do they make any difference to speed? Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at a few more possible options and see if there is a bit more performance to be gained.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the first attempt.\nfunction normalize_by_row_v2(arr) norms = Vector{Float64}(undef, size(arr)[1]) temp = arr.^2 for i in axes(arr,1) @views norms[i] = sqrt(sum(temp[i,:])) end return norms end julia\u0026gt; @btime nrm = normalize_by_row_v2($vec_1); 391.300 μs (4 allocations: 1.53 MiB) This implementation looks quite different from the first attempt which was a simple broadcasted one-line solution. This one has a loop! It\u0026rsquo;s also using a temporary array for storage and the views function to reduce copying to memory. Now here is the really interesting thing about Julia - even though I\u0026rsquo;ve reverted to a for-loop like tested earlier, performance has not been impacted at all. In fact, this implementation has reduced memory usage and the number of memory allocations, making the code more memory efficient without slowing things down. This is the really nice thing about using Julia: your code is automatically optimised!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another attempt at the one-liner with a subtle change from earlier that does improve the performance and it\u0026rsquo;s quite a significant jump. Julia is now approximately 3-5 times quicker than MATLAB and python.\nfunction normalize_by_row_v3(arr) sqrt.(sum(x-\u0026gt;x^2,arr, dims=2)) end julia\u0026gt; @btime nrm = normalize_by_row_v3($vec_1); 138.300 μs (8 allocations: 781.42 KiB) So now you must be thinking \u0026ldquo;we have not done much yet, maybe we can optimise this function more?\u0026rdquo;. To try and \u0026lsquo;scratch that itch\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve gone thorough the docs, watched a few youtube videos and scoured some of the popular user forums and come up with a few possible options. If it is possible to squeeze more performance, how much better can we do?\nAre loops really that bad? So I briefly mentioned this idea that loops are bad and you may be familiar with this concept if you are coming from python and MATLAB, where the for-loop option is often many times slower than the vectorised approach. But in my few examples, I\u0026rsquo;ve just demonstrated that this isn\u0026rsquo;t the case in Julia where a loop can achieve the same performance as the vectorised approach.\nThis is because all code is statically typed and then compiled, much like Fortran, C or Java and not interpreted like MATLAB or python. This static typing and compilation allows much more performance to be extracted as all the information is known beforehand and the compiler can then optimise the code into fast machine code whereas in interpreted languages there is a constant need to check everything as type information is often missing and then it needs to be translated into machine code at runtime. Packages like NumPy provide highly optimised functions that are actually compiled to C beforehand, hence their performance.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s partly where this \u0026ldquo;loops are bad\u0026rdquo; mentality comes from: in an interpreted language there are quick vectorised libraries that you can use and they are quicker than something that will be compiled into bytecode by the python compiler for example.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can optimise our Julia code by passing some additional instructions to the compiler to help it.\nfunction normalize_by_row_v4(arr) norms = Vector{Float64}(undef, size(arr)[1]) @inbounds for i in axes(arr, 1) anorm2 = zero(eltype(arr)) for j in axes(arr, 2) anorm2 += arr[i, j]^2 end norms[i] = sqrt(anorm2) end return norms end julia\u0026gt; @btime nrm = normalize_by_row_v4($vec_1); 91.700 μs (2 allocations: 390.67 KiB) Wow! So we have found another 30% reduction in from our best performing method so far but actually about 4x quicker than our previous looped example.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also possible to use the LoopVectorization package to enable some extra optimisations during the compilation process. Always verify that these optimisations don\u0026rsquo;t affect the results from your calculations as they may be doing something like changing the order of calculations. You have been warned!\nusing LoopVectorization function normalize_by_row_v4_turbo(arr) norms = Vector{Float64}(undef, size(arr)[1]) @turbo for i in axes(arr, 1) anorm2 = zero(eltype(arr)) for j in axes(arr, 2) anorm2 += arr[i, j]^2 end norms[i] = sqrt(anorm2) end return norms end julia\u0026gt; @btime nrm7 = normalize_by_row_v4_turbo($vec_1); 40.300 μs (2 allocations: 390.67 KiB) Another wow! By using the LoopVectorization package we can give the @turbo instruction to the compiler which really does add some turbo!! So there you have it, proof that loops are not bad! Our optimised Julia function has blown python and MATLAB out of the water and is now about 10-15x faster.\nThis was a relatively simple use case but highlights even for something simple there are possibly significant gains to be made. As I mentioned earlier Julia is still young but it appears to be reaching a point where it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to ignore it any more. There is no doubting it\u0026rsquo;s fast, it\u0026rsquo;s on the same level as C, C++ and Fortran and is a member of the Petaflop Club having achieved 1.54 petaflops with 1.3 million threads on the Cray XC40 supercomputer5.\nSummary One line summary - If you want to make your python code 10x times quicker use Julia!!\nWell that\u0026rsquo;s not really been the point of this post, but it is eye catching. 10x speedup is a lot.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more to Julia than just speed. It has an interactive REPL just like python, it is supported by Jupyter notebooks and has it\u0026rsquo;s own interactive notebooks called Pluto which I think are actually far superior. Want multi-threading? Done! Julia was created by MATLAB and python users so there will be a somewhat familiar feel to those making the transition.\nThere is also a growing eco-system that allows users start on tasks like solving lots of differential equations or machine learning without much development required by the user.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very impressed by where Julia has ended up after 10 years and it\u0026rsquo;s something I seriously consider now every time I am starting a new project as there is still some inertia in shifting completely from one language to a new one. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I will ever completely switch, but I do know I\u0026rsquo;m going to be using Julia a lot more in the future to reduce some of my computing bottlenecks in some tasks.\nHave you seen enough to tempt you into getting to know Julia a bit better?\nReferences Weisstein, Eric W. \u0026ldquo;Vector Norm.\u0026rdquo; From MathWorld\u0026ndash;A Wolfram Web Resource. https://mathworld.wolfram.com/VectorNorm.html.

When I originally created the site many years ago, the purpose was to learn something about html and css by taking on a project. It took me a while, and I was quite proud of the final output. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, but it had a fancy \u0026lsquo;slider carousel\u0026rsquo; and some nice css filters in the gallery (in my defence, it was 2012\u0026hellip;).\nHowever, after creating it, I quickly realised that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a whole lot to add to it and I found creating new posts for the blog a struggle. I wrote a few good posts that got some traction, but much of it was more personal in nature and possibly not of much interest to other people. The personal domain for email became the main thing I used and when I swapped providers a few years ago, the website didn\u0026rsquo;t get transferred.\nHomepage of Original Site This was probably a mistake - some of the posts were actually of interest and had lots of comments. I had been using wordpress to handle the blog but I never transferred out all the comments before just putting things on ice. So to anyone reading who may be about to do something similar - remember to back up or export things like comments as well as the raw data of the site. There is one saving grace The Wayback Machine which does a great job of keeping an archive of the web. Due to this fantastic resource I can still see snapshots of my website and the useful comments that were left. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a way to recover comments from this archive and re-import them to the current site? If you know how to do this, let me know in the comments below!\nVersion 2.0 So after years of manual html and css tinkering, I wanted something that was just as flexible but allowed easy content creation and the option to tinker and customise as required. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be tied to some CMS backend that limits what you can do. So I started doing some research!\nSo it turns out what I was looking for is a Static Site Generator, which basically takes some type of template file or files in one format and converts into lots of html and css files that can be deployed on your server. This has an advantage over dynamics sites as they should be faster to load and more secure.\nAnd there are lots of these SSG\u0026rsquo;s out there and in various languages. Jekyll, Gatsby and Hugo are just a few of the most common. I was drawn to Hugo by the fact that all the templating is written in markdown format, but also the claims of speed. Apparently, it\u0026rsquo;s very fast!\nGetting Started Since Hugo is quite popular, there are plenty of tutorials and guides out there and I started reading reading a few 1,2 to see where to get started. While doing a bit more reading, I came across a website called Wowchemy which promises quick and easy publishing for scientific and technical audiences (That\u0026rsquo;s me!).\nSo that is where I decided to start with the quickstart guide. This solutions saves the website in a GitHub repository and the website is deployed using Netlify. Netlify is basically the build manager and detects any new pushes to the repository, starts a build process and then deploys your built website. By default, you are assigned a custom Netlify domain, but you can quite easily set it up to use your own custom domain as well. Obviously Netlify offers a free package for personal sites which has 300 build minutes per month, which should be more than enough for most people.\nWowchemy Wochemy provides a few template pages for specific purposes such as individual pages or those for a research group. I cloned the Academic Resume theme, followed the instructions and had it deployed with Netlify in about 5-10 minutes. Very nice!\nThe wowchemy ecosystem consists of lots of elements, which are a bit like \u0026lsquo;building blocks\u0026rsquo; which can be used to create a page or site. There are lots of options such as posts, publications, sliders, galleries and much more. There\u0026rsquo;s code and math support as well as easy setup of some commenting systems. There\u0026rsquo;s even an CMS available if yuo wish to mange things that way.\nAnd because it\u0026rsquo;s based on Hugo and uses markdown, if there\u0026rsquo;s something you want to do that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already do, you can quite easily create something bespoke to your needs.\nSo while setting up the site from the template was quick, I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to take me a bit longer to customize it to my liking and restore old content.\nReferences https://kinsta.com/blog/hugo-static-site/ Accessed on 19/12/2021.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://strapi.io/blog/guide-to-using-hugo-site-generator Accessed on 19/12/2021.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1641146400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641146400,"objectID":"5e5f63ec8c01d0797cbdb0afc435eb21","permalink":"https://abrhaleyarefaine1997.github.io/post/new_site/","publishdate":"2022-01-02T18:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/new_site/","section":"post","summary":"A quick intorduction to my new website layout.","tags":["web","blog","wowchemy"],"title":"New Year, New Site","type":"post"},{"authors":["Abrhaley Arefaine Hailenchael","Kevin J.

I have typically avoided creating classes for storing data as it always seemed a bit of overkill for the job at hand. Lots of repetitive code with little actual reward.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a rather simple example of what I mean, where I\u0026rsquo;m gathering all the results of interest into a single return item for a function. I find this easier than having multiple returns from multiple functions.\nimport numpy as np from dataclasses import dataclass def some_complex_function(forces, scale): mult = np.pi**scale complex_calculated_forces = forces * mult result = dict() result[\u0026quot;val_x\u0026quot;] = complex_calculated_forces[:, 0] result[\u0026quot;val_y\u0026quot;] = complex_calculated_forces[:, 1] result[\u0026quot;val_z\u0026quot;] = complex_calculated_forces[:, 2] result[\u0026quot;mult\u0026quot;] = mult return result forces = np.random.random([1000,3]) calculated_forces = some_complex_function(forces, 4) calculated_forces.keys() This isn\u0026rsquo;t beautiful code, but it returns a single dict with all the related properties together, keeping the variable workspace a bit clearer in the process. Much handier if you need to pass this into several other functions later on in your workflow.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly re-usable and not great for modifying in future. Maybe a class would be a better option? But there\u0026rsquo;s so much effort involved in created a class I hear you say. All those __init__ and __repr__ methods that need to be defined, you may end up with a many lines of code for defining a very basic class.\nData Classes And that\u0026rsquo;s why data classes were introduced in python 3.7, to remove all that unnecessary boilerplate code required and just let you use the classes quickly.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my rather silly contrived example again, but this time using a fancy new data class.\nimport numpy as np from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass class resultant_force: x: np.ndarray y: np.ndarray z: np.ndarray multiplier: np.float64 def some_complex_function_using_dataclass(forces, scale): mult = np.pi**scale complex_calculated_forces = forces * mult return resultant_force(*complex_calculated_forces.T, mult) forces = np.random.random([1000,3]) force_dataclass = some_complex_function_using_dataclass(forces, 4) I can now run dir(force_dataclass) on my result and see that it\u0026rsquo;s a fully fledged class :\n['__annotations__', '__class__', '__dataclass_fields__', '__dataclass_params__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__slotnames__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'multiplier', 'x', 'y', 'z'] There\u0026rsquo;s even a repe created for free! So I can quite easily query force_dataclass.multiplier and get Out[4]: 97.40909103400242. What\u0026rsquo;s nice about this is now tht it\u0026rsquo;s a data class instead of a dictionary most IDE\u0026rsquo;s will autocomplete the dataclass fields for you, which is another bonus.\nThe other major benefit is now I have a nice reusable data container which I could make a little more generic and use in many places. I can do this because dataclasses also accept default values for fields. So I can change my previous class to something like this:\n@dataclass class resultant_force: x: np.ndarray y: np.ndarray z: np.ndarray multiplier: np.float64 = None def some_complex_function_using_dataclass(forces, scale): mult = np.pi**scale complex_calculated_forces = forces * mult return resultant_force(*complex_calculated_forces.T, mult) def some_complex_function_using_generic_dataclass(forces): complex_calculated_forces = forces * 2 return resultant_force(*complex_calculated_forces.T,) force_dataclass = some_complex_function_using_dataclass(forces, 4) generic_force_dataclass = some_complex_function_using_generic_dataclass(forces) And now from one simple change I have a generic data structure that can be used in multiple places, passing in the additional variables when needed, otherwise they are set to None.\nAnd data classes have one more nice trick where you can \u0026ldquo;embed\u0026rdquo; some calculation into the class.\n@dataclass class resultant_force: x: np.ndarray y: np.ndarray z: np.ndarray multiplier: np.float64 = None def __post_init__(self): self.custom_var = np.sum(self.x) / 3 def some_complex_function_using_generic_dataclass(forces): complex_calculated_forces = forces * 2 return resultant_force(*complex_calculated_forces.T,) force_dataclass = some_complex_function_using_dataclass(forces) This now calculates whatever is in the __post_init__ method when the object is created. This is very handy if you always do some calculation with the data in the class, just simply embed the calculation within the class and the result will be there for you when you need it!\nConclusion These are just some very simple examples of how useful data classes can be for organising and improving your code. I love how the boilerplate of class creation is gone, and how they can make code more readable and easier to maintain.\nThere are many other features you would expect of a class and these are also included such as automatic __repr__ and object comparison. There\u0026rsquo;s also easy conversion to lists and dictionaries.\nI suggest reading this post for a more detailed introduction to dataclasses and to see how they may help you.\n","date":1621188000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621188000,"objectID":"88e06542fbae31d7584b1b11d680619b","permalink":"https://abrhaleyarefaine1997.github.io/post/dataclasses/","publishdate":"2021-05-16T18:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dataclasses/","section":"post","summary":"An quick look at why data classes are so useful.","tags":["python","Data Analytics","Data"],"title":"Are you using Data Classes?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Abrhaley Arefaine Hailenchael"],"categories":["Numerical Methods","Data Analytics"],"content":"Introduction Working with Discrete Element Method (DEM) usually means that you need to visualise your results somehow after the simulation is complete. This is usually the case with some of the open source codes.

We always want more speed. If you can cut run time from 30 minutes to 10 minutes, then that is a huge gain.\nIn python there\u0026rsquo;s the usual performance gain coming from removing native loops and vectorising with NumPy, using pandas and then there\u0026rsquo;s even the new kid on the block, Numba (not actually that new now, but still newer!) which requires a bit more effort rewriting some code into functions that can be Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled. However, not everything can be compiled.\nBut there are also some other very simple performance tweaks that can be made and that can have a significant effect on runtime. That\u0026rsquo;s where Bottleneck comes in.\nBottleneck Bottleneck is a:\ncollection of fast, NaN-aware NumPy array functions written in C.\nBottleneck is basically a drop-in replacement for some popular NumPy functions such as sum, mean, min, max, etc. Please refer to the documentation for the full list.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a very simple example of bottleneck at work:\nimport numpy as np import bottleneck as bn a = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5]) np.nanmean(a) bn.nanmean(a) Bottleneck also provides some really useful rolling window functions that work along a single axis. Super easy and useful for calculating moving averages. The output will be the same shape as the input, but with the first few values smaller than the windo size returned as nan.\nb = np.random.random(100) rolling_avg_3 = bn.move_mean(b, window=3) rolling_avg_10 = bn.move_mean(b, window=10) Performance Bottleneck comes with a built in benchmarking suite that you can run on your machine to see what your performance will be like. Simply run bn.bench()\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the results output from my machine:\nBottleneck performance benchmark Bottleneck 1.3.2; Numpy 1.20.3 Speed is NumPy time divided by Bottleneck time NaN means approx one-fifth NaNs; float64 used no NaN no NaN NaN no NaN NaN (100,) (1000,1000)(1000,1000)(1000,1000)(1000,1000) axis=0 axis=0 axis=0 axis=1 axis=1 nansum 37.4 1.8 2.3 3.3 3.4 nanmean 99.5 2.2 3.0 4.3 4.2 nanstd 167.6 2.3 3.4 5.1 3.4 nanvar 165.2 2.2 2.5 4.1 2.9 nanmin 25.5 0.6 1.8 1.0 3.3 nanmax 24.2 0.8 1.9 0.8 3.1 median 113.3 1.3 3.8 1.1 3.8 nanmedian 113.3 6.5 7.1 5.5 5.9 ss 13.0 1.9 2.2 3.6 3.5 nanargmin 58.4 3.4 4.6 2.5 5.6 nanargmax 59.8 3.4 5.3 2.4 5.7 anynan 7.8 0.5 37.5 0.3 26.0 allnan 10.2 158.2 118.7 82.9 89.2 rankdata 23.5 1.3 1.3 2.6 2.6 nanrankdata 23.6 1.5 1.4 2.8 2.8 partition 4.6 1.0 1.3 0.9 1.3 argpartition 9.1 1.2 1.4 1.1 1.5 replace 7.6 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.9 push 1091.2 4.5 5.5 9.4 8.9 move_sum 2973.9 52.0 104.7 201.4 253.1 move_mean 7566.5 60.3 112.3 286.9 286.2 move_std 8564.2 73.8 146.0 190.7 302.7 move_var 11758.3 81.3 172.4 253.6 392.3 move_min 1361.0 15.6 31.8 22.8 53.8 move_max 1463.0 15.7 33.1 26.9 52.0 move_argmin 3319.4 67.4 102.3 77.0 128.4 move_argmax 3476.7 61.9 75.8 71.2 119.1 move_median 1704.8 137.2 160.7 171.2 185.9 move_rank 911.9 1.5 1.9 1.9 2.4 In the vast majority of cases bottleneck provides close to a 2x increase in performance of some of the most frequently used NumPy functions which can really help reduce that runtime and increase productivity.

Overview Handling of particulate products is a task that is at the core of many industries, from pharmaceuticals to foods to mining. However, all share a very similar challenge of keeping their processes flowing reliably, since cohesive particulates (either naturally cohesive or those affected by external factors such as moisture) can trigger difficult material handling situations. Measuring the flowability of such materials or characterising the properties for a DEM cohesive material model in a simulation is not necessarily a trivial task.\nThe flow function of a cohesive particulates is a material property that is typically measured to indicate the flowability and handleability of a material. In industry this is typically measured with some direct shear device such as a Jenike tester or a dynamic flow tester such as a FT4 Powder Rheometer. Ring shear testers and rotational testers are also frequently used. While each one has its advantages, many are compromised by the high cost, amount of time required for carrying out testing or lack of relevance to specific industrial situations.\nUniaxial testers offer an attractive alternative method for characterising the flowability of powders and sticky granular materials in industrial situations. Uniaxial testers apply a consolidation stress followed by a failure load vertically to a sample. This is appealing for being a mechanically simple device that’s easy to operate and also its physical similarity to the stress path associated with feeding industrial equipment and the unconfined yield strength 1. One of the challenges with uniaxial testers is achieving a uniform level of consolidation throughout the height of the sample, as wall friction can mean that the vertical stress in the sample at the bottom is significantly lower than the vertical stress applied at the top surface. To combat this there have been many designs considered over the years to deal this, each with their own strengths 2,3,4.\nThe University of Edinburgh had previous experience of developing successful uniaxial testers for sticky solids with larger particles 5. From this experience the Edinburgh Powder Tester (EPT) was developed for measuring the flowability of compressible cohesive powders with a focus on speed, robustness and high repeatability for industrial use 1. The key differences between the Edinburgh Powder Tester and some previous devices lie in the attention to mechanical details for both the consolidation and failure load application and the strategic intent 1, which means the EPT offers repeatable results in the range of 5-10% relative standard deviation (RSD) for a vast range of materials 6,7.\nRecently, Freeman Technology; which has many years of experience of both powder testing and development of testing apparatus, including extensive knowledge of shear cells; entered into a highly productive collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, DuPont and The Chemours Company to develop a uniaxial powder tester for the commercial market that incorporates the key design elements of the EPT. The result of this collaboration is ‘The Uniaxial Powder Tester from Freeman Technology’ which is a standalone uniaxial shear tester for powders, capable of testing a stress range of up to 100 kPa.\nThe simplicity and flexibility of uniaxial testers, coupled with a high level of repeatability, make uniaxial testers ideal tools for calibrating a DEM model for cohesive solids. The Freeman UPT, which is a semi-automated uniaxial tester, provides rapid measurements of key bulk mechanical properties of powders, including the stress–strain and the stress–density response during confined compression, the stress–strain response during unconfined compression including the peak unconfined strength and the increased cohesive (caking) strength developed over time in consolidation, all of which can be utilised for calibrating your DEM simulation of a cohesive solid to provide a realistic prediction.\nFreeman UPT Freeman UPT Consolidation Station References T.A.

Introduction Over the years, as the popularity of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) has continued to grow, it has been increasingly used as a design tool. The accuracy of these models largely depends on the chosen DEM model and its parameters, and as pointed out in a post by David Curry (What numbers should I put in? The perennial question for DEM users) the adage of “garbage in – garbage out” holds true when carrying out DEM simulations. For cohesionless materials we have a range of parameters to account for - size, shape, stiffness and friction being some of the more commonly considered. But how many materials are truly cohesionless? Not many, so we end up having to add some additional parameters to our DEM simulations to account for the additional cohesive forces in the material. The origin of these cohesive forces and their respective mechanics vary from long and short range non-contact interaction forces, mechanical interlock, electrostatic forces, solid bridges and liquid bridges to name but a few.\nSo how does one go about capturing all of these phenomena in their DEM simulation? The first step is selecting a suitable contact model – a liquid bridge model is not much use for capturing the behaviour of fine particles in an electrostatic field. Provided you have negotiated that stage and selected a suitable contact model; you are then faced with the much more difficult proposition of model calibration.\nCalibration To some, “calibration” is a dirty word that simply means ‘cheating until you get the right answer’, but we can define it more concisely as “the process of adjusting physical modelling parameters in the computational model to improve agreement with experimental data” 1. Calibration isn’t a bad thing, it’s a necessary part of scientific life – we need to regularly calibrate our measuring instruments to ensure accuracy. Due to the assumptions we make in DEM; in relation to particle shape and number of particles we use to represent a system amongst other things; we need to calibrate our input parameters such that they provide a realistic result.\nAnd much like the choice of contact model, the choice of calibration experiment is also important – you would not choose a quasi-static experiment to calibrate for a very dynamic regime as you may fail to capture much of the key behaviour such as impact dynamics. Obtaining suitable calibration data can be a challenge as one would like them to be both easily obtained and be highly repeatable.\nThe typical process of calibrating DEM contact model parameters involves tuning the observed response of the simulation to closely reproduce the macroscopic bulk behaviour measured in the calibration experiment. The mechanical behaviour of cohesive powders can be carefully measured using element tests such as biaxial test, true triaxial and hollow cylinder tests. However, in practice these tests can be expensive and slow to conduct and are rarely performed for industrial applications requiring material characterisation. More typically a test such as direct shear, ring shear, unconfined compression, triaxial compression or cone penetration is carried out.\nThe Case for Uniaxial Testers For example, in industry the flow function of a cohesive solid is typically measured using either a ring shear tester or Jenike shear tester but these have some drawbacks. The Jenike test, whilst appearing to be quite straight forward is time consuming and can often be highly operator sensitive, both of which are problems when you want to have a high level of confidence in the result to use for calibration. Ring shear testers remove the operator sensitivity and repeatability problem by being highly automated, computer controlled devices but these can be very expensive to purchase and maintain. They also have particle size restrictions due to their small volume and may be limited to relatively low stress ranges which may not cover the range of interest.\nUniaxial testers offer an alternative method for characterising the flowability of powders and fine granular materials in industrial situations. Uniaxial testers apply a consolidation stress vertically and also apply the failure load vertically. This is appealing for two reasons: firstly it’s a mechanically simple device that’s easy to operate and secondly it’s physical similarity to the stress path associated with arching and the unconfined yield strength 2. One of the challenges with uniaxial testers is achieving a uniform level of consolidation throughout the depth of the sample, as wall friction can mean that the vertical stress in the sample at the bottom is significantly lower than the vertical stress applied at the top surface. To combat this there have been many designs considered over the years to deal this, each with their own strengths 3,4,5.\nThe University of Edinburgh had previous experience of developing successful uniaxial testers for large diameter particles 6. From this experience the Edinburgh Powder Tester (EPT) was developed for measuring the flowability of highly compressible, high value powders. While many previous efforts have focussed heavily on accurate laboratory measurement of unconfined yield strength, the Edinburgh testers aimed at speed, robustness and high repeatability for industrial use, with a close match to a Jenike cell being a secondary objective 2. The key differences between the Edinburgh Powder Tester and some previous devices lie in the attention to mechanical details for both the consolidation and failure load application and the strategic intent 2, which means the EPT offers repeatability results in the range of 5-10% relative standard deviation (RSD) for a vast range of materials 7, 8.\nEdinburgh Powder Tester (EPT) Consolidated sample exposed prior to failure Failed sample It is the simplicity and flexibility of uniaxial testers, coupled with a high level of repeatability, that make uniaxial testers ideal tools for calibrating DEM simulations of cohesive solids. For example, the EPT, which is a semi-automated uniaxial tester, can provide rapid measurements of various bulk mechanical properties of powders, including the stress–strain and the stress–porosity response during confined compression, the stress–strain response during unconfined compression including the peak unconfined strength and the caking strength over time consolidation, all of which can be utilised for calibrating you DEM simulation of a cohesive solid.\nRecently, Freeman Technology; which has many years of experience of both powder testing and development of testing apparatus, including extensive knowledge of shear cells; entered into a highly productive collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, DuPont and The Chemours Company to develop a uniaxial powder tester for the commercial market that incorporates the key design elements of the EPT. The result of this collaboration is ‘The New Uniaxial Powder Tester from Freeman Technology’ which is a standalone uniaxial shear tester for powders, capable of testing a stress range of up to 100 kPa. The UPT comes in two versions: a manual version, which is ideally suited for quality control measurement in industrial situations and the advanced version with increased automation and reduction in operator inputs and advanced data logging capabilities which makes it very suitable as a DEM calibration tool for cohesive powders.\nFreeman UPT Freeman UPT Consolidation Station A DEM Example Case At the University of Edinburgh, we have used uniaxial testers (EPT/UPT) extensively for calibrating DEM parameters for the Edinburgh Cohesion Model in EDEM 7,8,9,10,11,12 (which is currently available on the EDEM User forum and will be part of future versions of EDEM) due to the high level of repeatability and the flexibility to measure key properties quickly and easily in the laboratory.\nAs an example, the measured stress-strain curves from the EPT for an iron ore solid at varying moisture contents (levels of cohesion) are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. A typical set of unconfined test results that make up a single uniaxial flow function (the peak strength vs. the consolidation stress) are shown for the same iron ore fines in Figure 8 for a single moisture content.\nConfined Stress Strain measured in EPT for iron ore fines Unconfined Stress-Strain measured in EPT for iron ore fines Measured bulk density variation of iron ore fines These measured values provide the range of various properties to be captured within the DEM simulation. A typical DEM simulation of a cohesive solid in the EPT is shown in Figure 9. The DEM simulation consists of the filling, confined compression, unloading of the sample and the crushing to failure of the unconfined sample.\nFigure 9 - DEM simulation of cohesive solid in the EPT: a) Filling b) Confined consolidation c) Unloading and removal of confining sleeve d) Loading to Unconfined failure (uUYS) The measured properties provide the necessary information to define the loading stiffness, plasticity ratio and whether the material is exhibiting linear or non-linear stiffness, bulk density and level of cohesion to calibrate the DEM model. In order to capture the behaviour at different moisture contents, we need to calibrate the level of cohesion for each moisture content at one point on the flow function, as in Figure 10.\nExperimental results and calibrated DEM results Once calibrated, it is possible capture the entire flow function spectrum for varying moisture contents with a good degree of accuracy, as shown in Figure 11, with the effect of moisture influencing only one model parameter i.e. the contact surface energy $\\delta \\gamma $.\nThis process provides a fully calibrated DEM model for cohesive powders for use in DEM simulations.\nCalibrated Flow function vs Experimental flow function References American Society of Mechanical Engineers., Guide for verification and validation in computational solid mechanics, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2006. https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/v-v-10-2006-guide-verification-validation (accessed July 13, 2017).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nT.A.

A cached copy of that post can be found here.\nIntroduction EDEM has just announced the new 2018 version of the software that includes many new features with a focus on performance on productivity. I don\u0026rsquo;t normally show much interest in the release of new version of software but this is a bit different. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to announce that the Edinburgh Elasto-Plastic Adhesion (EEPA) Model1,2 which started it\u0026rsquo;s life in my Ph.D.\nThis is a significant milestone and highlights how popular the model has become since it\u0026rsquo;s release as an API model to EDEM users just over 3 years ago. EDEM is considered the leading Discrete Element Method software application for bulk material simulation in the market and is used my many companies across fields as varied as mining, food manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. EDEM is also used by thousands of researchers in more then 200 universities around the world.\nIn parallel, a new contact model for modeling complex cohesive materials such as fine dry powders, organic materials, soil and ore fines is now available as a standard built-in contact model in EDEM. This model, called Edinburgh Elasto-Plastic Adhesion (EEPA), offers a solution for cohesive granular solids whose behavior changes depending on the stresses experienced by the material beforehand. It can help realistically simulate applications such as material adhesion to earthmoving equipment, soil-tyre interaction or for instance a cohesive powder compaction process such as tabletting.\nThis will allow users to take advantage of the EEPA model without the computational cost of running the API. This could be as much as 30% reduction in runtime for your simulations - effectively for free!! All of the features of the API model 3,4 exist and are nicely integrated into the GUI. There should also be a GPU implementation of the modelling making bigger simulations more tractable.\nEEPA now available in Contact Model Physics Inputting EEPA Parameters I hope this helps making simulation of cohesive granular materials more accessible to more user and that the models popularity continues to grow.\nCitations Abrhaley Arefaine Hailenchael, 2013.

Inspecting large dataset distributed over numerous clusters located remotely, is often a significant difficulty to be overcome to ensure that users (both in academia and industry) are able to take the best advantage of current (and future) HPC infrastructures.\nThe Vision of VELaSSCo is to provide new approaches for visual analysis of large-scale simulations for the Exabyte era. It does this by building on big data tools and architectures for the engineering and scientific community and by adopting new ways of in-situ processing for data analytics and hardware accelerated interactive visualization.\nTo better manipulate the data from simulations with billions of records it is crucial that the engineering and scientific community adopts big data tools. VELaSSCo will provide a simulation data analysis platform consisting of:\nA database structure, based on widely used technologies such as Hadoop-HBase, that can organise and store a diverse range of large-scale simulation data sets for collaborative use. An innovative approach, adopting big data best practices, to handle large scale simulation data sets that have to be stored on multiple servers. A framework equipped with advanced in-situ processing tools to analyse the output of parallel simulation solvers. An analysis platform to analyse and visualize large-scale data sets interactively. This builds on leading edge graphics hardware. Project Partners The VELaSSCo consortium has a wide variety of expertise aligned with the objectives of the project. Expertise of the partners can be classified mainly in two principal categories: Institutions specialized in the development and implementation of visualization software, particularly addressed to facilitate analysis of HPC simulations in engineering and scientific first-class problems (CIMNE, UNEDIN and FRAUNHOFER); and institutions with experience in Data Analytics, Big Data, Big Data Handling and Cloud Computing (SINTEF, INRIA, JOTNE and ATOS).\nThe partnership also counts with a large group of potential end-users of the outcomes of the projects, ranging from large engineering companies, SME\u0026rsquo;s on engineering modelling and software houses, to research organisations doing large scale engineering modelling, linked to the User Panel already described.\nList of partners:\nCentre Internacional de Metodes Numerics en Enginyeria (CIMNE) The University of Edinburgh SINTEF Institute of Information and Communications Technology Institut National De Recherche En Informatique Et En Automatique (INRIA) Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD AtoS Spain Jotne Project Gallery ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"7039e2da937065b3d9e8f4df363d8fc9","permalink":"https://abrhaleyarefaine1997.github.io/project/velassco/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/velassco/","section":"project","summary":"The Vision of VELaSSCo is to provide new approaches for visual analysis of large-scale simulations for the Exabyte era.","tags":["DEM","FEM","CFD","Data Visualisation","Data Analytics","Big Data"],"title":"VELaSSCo: Visualization for Extremely Large-scale Scientific Computing","type":"project"},{"authors":["G.

The most commonly used equation was proposed originally by Jaky (1944) which expresses the ratio of horizontal to vertical stress in a normally consolidated soil as K0 = 1 - sin $\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the effective angle of internal friction of the soil. This raises the question as to why the at rest stress state in a soil, which is not at failure, should be governed by the failure friction angle of the soil. The expression is often reported as empirical in nature however, Jaky arrived at the expression from an analytical approach. This paper explores the micromechanics of cohesionless soils by investigating the effect of soil fabric and the evolution of the lateral pressure under confined compression using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Many DEM models use spherical particles due to their greater efficiency. However, particle sphericity leads to the over-prediction of the lateral pressure ratio for a typical granular soil during a confined K0 compression test. The lack of particle interlocking that is associated with spherical particles leads to a greater transmission of forces laterally in an assembly under confined compression, resulting in a higher K0 value.","tags":["DEM","PBM","K0","Lateral earth pressure"],"title":"A discrete element analysis of the micromechanical interaction of non-spherical particles in cohesionless granular solids under K$_0$ condition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

The uniaxial test was conducted using the semi-automated uniaxial EPT tester in which the cohesive strength of a bulk solid is evaluated from an unconfined compression test following a period of consolidation to a pre-defined vertical stress. The iron ore fines were also tested by measuring both the vertical and circumferential strains on the cylindrical container walls under vertical loading in a separate confined compression tester – the K$_0$ tester, to determine the lateral pressure ratio. \n\nDiscrete Element Method simulations of both experiments were carried out and the predictions were compared with the experimental observations. A recently developed DEM contact model for cohesive solids, an Elasto-Plastic Adhesive model, was used. This particle contact model uses hysteretic non-linear loading and unloading paths and an adhesion parameter which is a function of the maximum contact overlap. The model parameters for the simulations are phenomenologically based to reproduce the key bulk characteristics exhibited by the solid. The simulation results show a good agreement in capturing the stress history dependent behaviour depicted by the flow function of the cohesive iron ore fines while also providing a reasonably good match for the lateral pressure ratio observed during the confined compression K0 tests. This demonstrates the potential for the DEM model to be used in the simulation of bulk handling applications.","tags":["Adhesion","Cohesive solid","Contact model","Discrete element method","DEM","Granular material","contact"],"title":"Experimental and discrete element modelling of cohesive iron ore fines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction This project attempts to deal with the challenges associated with handling and storage of cohesive solids in the mining industry. An adhesive-frictional model has been recently developed for DEM simulation of cohesive particles at the University of Edinburgh. This project will exploit the new method for modelling cohesive particulates for specific problems, such as effect of fines in silo discharge and the effect of time consolidation.\nFines are produced during transportation, handling and storing of iron pellets. The presence of fines can significantly affect the behaviour of iron ore pellets during these processes. In addition, increased volumes of sinter fines are being produced and handled and their behaviour can also be significantly affected.\nSilos and other equipment handling the fines can experience such phenomena as caking, arching and alteration of flow pattern, leading to operational difficulties.\nThe behaviour of fines is extremely complex, affected by numerous factors such as particle size, size distribution, stress level (e.g. the maximum vertical stress in a silo), stress state (i.e. the stresses in different directions), stress history, temperature, moisture content, time and chemical bond/fusion. Different combinations of these factors can lead to different behaviours, such as caking with different strength and size, which in turn result in different effects on the solids flow in silos and other handling scenarios in the mining industry.\nDEM simulations can also be affected by the prescribed boundary conditions and as such the effect of oversimplification of the degrees of freedom for a Jenike cell are explored in detail, through the use of fully coupled multi-body dynamics for all geometry movements.\nImage Gallery Video Gallery ","date":1374883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1374883200,"objectID":"38c4efdd657e3e9fe3d099e6c3c4b954","permalink":"https://abrhaleyarefaine1997.github.io/project/post_doc/","publishdate":"2013-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/post_doc/","section":"project","summary":"This project attempts to deal with the challenges associated with handling and storage of cohesive solids in the mining industry.","tags":["DEM","Data Analytics","Temperature dependent","Time dependent","Coupling","MBD","Adhesion","Cohesion","EEPA","EBBM"],"title":"Transporting, handling and storing behaviour of iron ore fines","type":"project"},{"authors":["Abrhaley Arefaine Hailenchael"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to get publication metadata for your reference management software in .bib format.

Table of Contents Introduction The Castle The Estate Family History A terrible decision Introduction For those of you who are familiar with your history or architecture the name of John Nash will sound quite familiar. Nash is a famous British architect who was responsible for much of the design of Regency London. From 1810 onwards he was mainly employed by the then Prince Regent, who would later become King George IV, and worked on very few private projects in this time. His first task for the Prince was the development of Regent Street and the surrounding area. Some of his most famous work include the Royal Pavilion in Brighton and the development of Buckingham House in to Buckingham palace, the Royal Mews and the Marble Arch, which would later become the entrance to Hyde Park.\nAnyway I’m talking about John Nash now as I’m at home for the Christmas period and was recently passing through my local town (Cahir, Co. Tipperary) which owes quite a bit of its heritage to a certain John Nash. He was responsible for one of the towns most visited attractions, the Swiss Cottage and several other buildings (Erasmus Smith School and St. Paul\u0026rsquo;s Church of Ireland) in the town. The Swiss Cottage is an ornamental cottage that was built for the Baron of Cahir in 1810. The cottage has a thatched roof and includes rooms full of fancy furniture and hand-painted wallpapers. The cottage was fully restored in 1989 and is now open to the public and is a major tourist attraction for the town along with the stunning medieval castle in the town centre. Nash was also responsible for the design of the school which I attended, which was originally the Erasmus Smith School when it was constructed and the nearby St. Paul\u0026rsquo;s church which is one of only two known churches by the Royal Architect in Ireland, and the only one with a nearly complete interior.\nBut these are all just the side story to the main act. Shanbally Castle. Or at least they would be if it wasn’t for some abysmal decision making. Shanbally Castle is situated just about 1km from my family home, which itself and the neighbouring houses were all once part of the Shanbally Estate and were constructed to provide accommodation for the staff of the Estate. But the castle is no more, and that is a huge loss, both for the local community and Ireland at large. As a building designed by the famous architect of the Prince Regent, one of only a handful of castles he built in Ireland, this was the largest of all those. Nash’s other famous castles were Ravensworth and Caerhays in England, with Shanbally being the last of his fine country homes to be built.\n“Shanbally also had the distinction that it was built, not for the descendant of some Cromwellian carpetbagger, but for the scion of an old Irish family, Cornelius O’Callaghan.” 1\nThe Castle Cornelius O’Callaghan engaged John Nash to design Shanbally Castle in 1810, which was situated between the Galtee Mountains and the Knockmealdown Mountains in South Tipperary. Construction was completed around 1819. The castle and estate was the property of the Earls of Ormonde (the Butlers: a powerful Norman ruling family) and whose principal residence was Kilkenny Castle.\nThe Estate comprised of 600 acres of farmland and 400 acres of woodland. The estate also included the estate manager’s house, and three houses which were known as ‘lodges’, and these were occupied by caretakers. There was Finn’s lodge; Carey’s lodge, and Norris’s lodge, and the whole estate was surrounded by a high stone wall, which was known by the local people as the ‘demesne wall’.\nThe castle location can be seen in the following historical maps from the OSI (Note: need to select historic map layer as the historic map is not the default).\nThe nearby Galtee Mountains also formed part of the Shanbally Estate and guests at the castle hunted deer and pheasant on the mountain. To facilitate this a hunting lodge (Mountain Lodge) was erected there in the 1830’s, and has for many years now been a youth hostel, having been acquired by An Óige for hikers. There was also a two-storey summerhouse down by the lake which was known as the tea-rooms.\nShanbally Castle with its 20 stately bedrooms, extensive drawing rooms, dining room, library, marble fireplaces and mahogany staircase was long and irregular in layout, made of a silver-grey ashlar and built in a Gothic Revival style. It had numerous machicolations, towers and battlements. The magnificent building can be seen in the following photos taken circa 1865.\nIn its heyday, Shanbally Castle was entered under a porte-cochère (carriage porch) into the main entrance hall. This was divided from the billiard room by a gothic arch. Directly beyond was a large top-lit gallery, at one end of which was an imperial staircase. Both of these rooms had fan-vaulted ceilings, while the ceilings in the other main rooms of the castle had excellent gothic plasterwork.\n“To the right of the entrance hail was the dining room, while the garden front of the castle had, from left to right, the following; a dining room in the great round tower, lit by three lancet windows; a library, which occupied the central section of this front (also lit by three gothic windows); and, farther on, there was a conservatory of six bays with pointed windows.”\nMain groundfloor gallery Inside of drawing room Main library Main staircase from Gallery Vaulted ceiling over main staircase Octagonal tea room It has been noted that Shanbally bore a considerable resemblance to Nash and Repton\u0026rsquo;s joint venture, Luscombe Castle in Devon, all though Shanbally Castle was considerably larger. There is a stronger resembalnce to Caerhays Castle - You can judge for yourself here.\nCaerhays Castle, Cornwall, England Caerhays Castle, Cornwall, England Shanbally castle was a magnificent house that was situated on landscaped gardens, with the whole lot over-looking a private lake which was often used activities such as boating. The woods belonging to the castle was used for rearing game, and visiting gentry to the castle enjoyed themselves in shooting parties there.\nAerial view of Shanbally Castle, in early 20th century Even a reigning king and queen of England were entertained at Shanbally Castle. When, as king and queen, the royal couple of Edward VII and Alexandra visited Ireland in 1904 on a private trip to Kilkenny Castle (the seat of the Ormonde\u0026rsquo;s), Waterford and Lismore, they visited Shanbally Castle on their tour 2. This was likely due to the Marquess of Ormonde\u0026rsquo;s connection to the British royal family and their very powerful political position in Ireland for hundreds of years; the Ormonde\u0026rsquo;s attended the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911 3.\nThe Estate A major part of the staff for the castle and estate hailed from nearby Glencallaghan and Clogheen, a house generally going with the job. Between the running of the estate farms, gardens, stables and the main house itself (along with maintenance for other estate properties) there were many locals people employed. I can’t give exact numbers but I have come across a list of about 25 people who were employed by the estate.\nAccommodation for the staff consisted of 11 houses in Glencallaghan, 2 more located in Carrickmore, another 8 adjacent to Clogheen and a large number of houses in Clogheen. There was also a head gardener’s house, a shepherd’s house and a gamekeeper’s house.\nThe Estate was completely self-sufficient. Water for the castle and estate properties was pumped from two dams where DC electricity was also generated. Large flocks of sheep grazed on the mountains and these were cared for by the estate’s shepherds. Wool from these flocks was processed and woven into tweed for the family’s riding habits at nearby Ardfinnan Woollen Mills.\nTo the side of the castle on a slight rise of ground there stood a round, stone building called the Observatory. Also, on the grounds, there was a dogs’ and horses’ cemetery, complete with memorial headstones.\nMany fine hunters were bred at Shanbally, including Cottage, ancestor of the famous ‘Cottage’ line of race horses, the most well-known of which was Sheila’s Cottage, winner of the Grand National in the 1940’s. Also, Cottage Rake, which won the King George VI chase in 1948 at Kempton. Cottage Rake won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1948, 1949 and 1950. This horse was trained by Vincent O’Brien at Ballydoyle.\nWith the passing of years the estate experienced difficult times and was eventually acquired by the Land Commission. All workers were given their houses to purchase for very little money, and some of these houses are still occupied by their descendants.\nFamily History The following information about the family that built and lived in Shanbally Castle can be found in “The Lost Houses of Ireland: A Chronicle of the Great Houses and the Families who Lived There”1. The O’ Callaghan’s held the lands at Shanbally (Seanbhaile or ‘the old town’) for many generations. Thomas O’Callaghan of Shanbally married Sarah, the daughter of John Davis and his wife, the Honourable Ann Caulfield, daughter of the 2nd Viscount Caulfield. Thomas and Sarah’s son, Cornelius O’Callaghan was the member for Fethard in four parliaments in Dublin from 1761. In 1785, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lismore of Shanbally. He married Frances Ponsonby, daughter of the Right Honourable John Ponsonby, who was Speaker of the Irish House of Commons in Grattan’s parliament, and died in 1797.\nTheir heir was Cornelius O’Callaghan, and Baron Lismore, who was raised to a viscountcy in 1806.\nIn 1807, Cornelius made an unsuccessful attempt to be elected as a Representative Peer of Ireland. He eventually got to parliament in 1838, when he was created Baron Lismore of Shanbally Castle in the peerage of the United Kingdom — one of Queen Victoria’s coronation peerages. Cornelius was also Lord Lieutenant of County Tipperary but scandal followed in 1826 when he divorced his wife Lady Eleanor Butler, the daughter of the Earl of Ormond and Ossory. Cornelius died at Shanbally Castle, the house he had commissioned.\nHis son, George Ponsonby O’Callaghan, 2nd Viscount Lismore, married Mary Norbury in 1839. He was Sheriff of County Tipperary in 1853 and Lord Lieutenant of the county between 1857 and 1885. His only son, the Honourable George Cornelius O’Callaghan, married Rosina, the widow of Edward Follett, at Umballa in India in 1874, but died childless at only 39. The 2nd Viscount was a Liberal until 1886 in which year, and in opposition to Gladstone’s attempts to introduce Home Rule for Ireland, he left the party, but he remained a Unionist. The Government offered him the Order of Saint Patrick in 1864 but he declined the honour and the peerages died with him in 1898 as both his sons pre-deceased him. His will was proved at £20,000.\nHis lordship was a victim of the Land War that took place during the 1880s, and he had a lot of land to be worried about. In 1883, his estates comprised 34,945 acres in County Tipperary, together with Shanbally Castle (1000 acres were all that was left in 1954 to be sold to the Land Commission), 6067 acres in County Cork and 1194 acres in County Limerick — making a total of 42,206 acres with an annual rent roll of £16,354.\nAfter the last of the O’ Callaghan male heirs had deceased the castle then passed through the female line. It escaped the phase of house burnings that took place during the War of Independence, although the IRA did use it in 1921 as a training centre. When peace returned, two daughters of the 3rd Marquess of Ormonde, Lady Constance Butler and her sister, Lady Beatrice Pole-Carew, occupied the castle almost until the time of its destruction. Lady Constance continued to live in a wing of Shanbally until her death 1949, well after World War II. After the death of Lady Beatrice Pole-Carew in 1952, there was a five-day sale of the contents of the house.\nA terrible decision As time passed by the influence and wealth of the family declined and in 1954, Major Pole-Carew sold the estate to the Land Commission, which acquired 750 acres of arable land and 250 acres of woodland, as well as Shanbally Castle. For a short period it appeared that a buyer could be found for the castle and despite the attempts of a religious community and of Edward Sackville, 5th Lord Sackville of Knole to buy it. He agreed to buy the castle, together with 163 acres (0.66 km2), but pulled out of the transaction when the Irish Land Commission refused to stop cutting trees in the land he intended to buy. However, by 1957 it had been decided that Nash’s fine house should be levelled to the ground. At this point the castle was still in good condition, having been lived in up until quite close to the sale.\n“Not only was the building of the first importance in the history of Irish domestic architecture but it was also in good and complete condition before it fell afoul of the crass ignorance and prejudice of the bureaucrats who decided to destroy it.”\nFirst the civil servants gave instructions to remove the roof and the fitments. Then, in a wicked act of destruction the battlements were hacked down. This drew a protest from Professor Denis Gwynn, Chairman of the Cork Advisory Group of the Arts Council, to the Minister of Lands, Erskine Childers.\nIn that year, Professor Denis Gwynn, wrote an article in the Cork Examiner in which he pleaded with the authorities to reverse their decision:\n`Shanbally Castle has been well known for years as one of the most graceful and original examples in Ireland of late Georgian architecture, Its formal gardens, which have run wild, could easily be brought back to order'\nDescribing the order to demolish the castle as an \u0026lsquo;act of vandalism\u0026rsquo;, Professor Gwynn called for an inquiry into the circumstances of the decision.\n`There is no sense whatever in squandering public money on the destruction of a beautiful house which is well known to students of Nash\u0026rsquo;s domestic architecture’.\nHe received a reply stating that the Minister would be unavailable until mid-October, but would give the matter his fullest attention when he returned to work. But Professor Gwynn\u0026rsquo;s article was already too late. Despite some local opposition and widespread critical comment, the roof was removed and some of its impressive cut stones were being removed by hand and broken into smaller pieces for use in road building.\nThe demolition had started in September. The beautiful lawn trees at Shanbally were cut down and ‘rapidly carted away’. The Land Commission had sold the castle to a Limerick firm who razed it to the ground in order to salvage materials from the ruins and these were sold at public auction by a Limerick auctioneer. The \u0026lsquo;philistines\u0026rsquo; who did this were merely symptomatic of the general attitude of the population at the time. The Land Commission issued the following notice: ‘The beautiful cut stone of the Castle will no doubt be put to practical use’.\nThe Government Information Bureau, in an attempt to defend the vandalism, issued the following statement, which although suited their narrative, should be considered a blatant lie:\n‘Apart from periods of military occupation the castle has remained wholly unoccupied for 40 years.’\nThis attempt at deception was shown up for what it was when letters arrived at the newspapers from people who had bought items at the sale of the castle’s contents less than 20 years before. Indeed, a part of it had been lived in until a few years before its destruction. Undaunted by the truth, the government decided to press ahead with the demolition and the breaking up of the cut stone for the ‘practical use’ of surfacing roads.\nFinally, in March 1960, explosives had to be used to demolish what remained of the castle, as it had been so well been built. According to a report in the local newspaper “The Nationalist”, on March 21st 1960:\n`A big bang yesterday ended Shanbally Castle, where large quantities of gelignite and cortex shattered the building\u0026rsquo;.\nDemolition experts bored no fewer than 1400 holes into the walls about 18 inches from the ground in order to level this once great building.\nWhen the government apologists wrote that that the castle was in a dangerous state, Professor Gwynn: replied that\n‘Shanbally Castle would not even have been a ruin if the Government had not authorised the removal of its roof and interior fittings.’\nHe went on about this wanton destruction\n‘the slate and finely cut stone and the beautiful ornamented ceilings are already littering the ground,’\nand reminded his readers that it could have been restored for a fraction of the cost of its destruction.\nThe Cork Examiner commented, in 1957 that:\n‘Unless the present trends of the Department of Lands are stayed, there will be nothing in fifty years left to link the age of the Norman castle tower as a habitation, and the latest concrete semi-detached council house.’\nAll of this has gone, a victim of an ignorant mentality. A two-storey summerhouse down by the lake is all that remains of a house and a demesne which, if the government had allowed it to survive, would today be one of the treasures of Ireland’s heritage.\nPhoto Gallery References Randall MacDonnell, \u0026ldquo;The Lost Houses Of Ireland: A Chronicle of the Great Houses and the Families Who Lived There\u0026rdquo;, 2002.

Cohesive solids can experience a number of flow problems including arching, ratholing, segregation, channelling and flooding. A better understanding of these problems can help to improve the handling of these solids and provide optimised solutions. The discrete element method (DEM) using soft contact approach as proposed by Cundall and Strack (1979) has been widely used to investigate the behaviour of granular materials subject to a variety of loading conditions.

The stress regimes experienced by the granular solids vary and the exhibited bulk behaviours can be complex and unexpected. The prevalence of granular solids makes them an area of interest for industry and researchers alike as many challenges still remain, such as dealing with complex cohesive behaviour in materials, which often gives rise to handling difficulties. The cohesive strength of a bulk material depends on the consolidation stress it has experienced. As a result, the stress history in the material leading up to a handling scenario needs to be considered when evaluating its handling behaviour.\nStorage and transportation are an important part of the process chain for industries where particulate solids are commonplace. Failure to properly account for the cohesive nature of a particulate solid can be costly as it can easily lead to blockages in a silo such as ratholing or arching near the outlet during discharge.\nResearch Goals Cohesive granular solids such as powders can have a very loose, highly porous structure under very low stresses. While it is possible to generate similar initial packing structures in a DEM simulation, it is not feasible to attempt to match all stress states. In this study, stress states larger than 5-10 kPa are of interest and as such all packing structures will aim to match the experimental results from this stress level.\nNumerical The main aim of the research is to develop an improved contact model to better capture the behaviour of cohesive granular solids, particularly iron ore fines, which are significantly affected by the presence of moisture. In order for numerical simulations to be successfully used for more efficient design and management of industrial equipment and structures, the transition from qualitative to quantitative prediction needs to be made.\nIn this study a mesoscopic adhesive contact model that accounts for contact plasticity and stress history dependency in the bulk solid, the Edinburgh Elasto-Plastic Adhesion (EEPA) mode, has been presented and mathematically verified. A parametric study of the DEM contact model parameters was conducted to gain a deeper understating of the effect of input parameters on the simulated cohesive bulk behaviour.\nEdinburgh Elasto-Plastic Adhesion (EEPA) Model The EEPA contact model has been used to predict an experimental flow function of KPRS iron ore fines. The contact model has demonstrated the ability to capture the stress history dependent behaviour that exists in cohesive granular solids. The DEM simulations provide a very close match to the experimental flow functions, with the predicted unconfined strengths found to be within the standard deviations of the experimental results.\nComparison between Experimental and DEM Flow Functions for Iron ore fines Investigations into the failure mode predicted by the DEM simulations show that the samples are failing from the development of shear planes similar to those observed experimentally.\nShear Failure mode in DEM Simulations: a) DEM Simulation b) Coarse-grained angular velocity in sample c) Coarse-grained solid fraction in sample Experimental To help achieve this a secondary aim is to rigorously characterise the properties of the material that are required for calibration of a numerical model. A study of the effect of the parameters of the adhesive contact model is also carried out. In this study a particular focus is paid to the two types of iron ore fines: KPBO and KPRS, with the purpose of characterising the different materials types and assessing the distinct behaviour exhibited by the different fines.\nA comprehensive study on the effect of cohesion arising from the addition of moisture on the behaviour of two types of LKAB iron ore fines (KPBO and KPRS) has been carried out using a uniaxial tester, the Edinburgh Powder Tester (EPT).\nEdinburgh Powder Tester (EPT) The addition of moisture to the sample has been found to have a significant effect on both kinds of fines. KPRS fines were found to have a much higher unconfined strength and flow function at higher moisture contents, and also show a greater increase in cohesion with the addition of moisture, while at moisture contents of less than 2% the KPBO fines demonstrate higher unconfined yield strength. The KPBO fines were also found to achieve a significantly looser initial packing at much lower moisture content when compared to the KPRS fines. The lateral pressure ratio has also been evaluated.\nImage Gallery Video Gallery ","date":1254009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1254009600,"objectID":"9723547690e3a2bfcc5abe05ad0b6994","permalink":"https://abrhaleyarefaine1997.github.io/project/phd/","publishdate":"2009-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"Characterisation and calibration of iron ore fines for DEM simulations","tags":["DEM","Data Analytics","Calibration","Characterisation"],"title":"Discrete Element Modelling of Iron Ore Pellets to Include the Effects of Moisture and Fines","type":"project"},{"authors":["Abrhaley Arefaine Hailenchael"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to get publication metadata for your reference management software in .bib format.
