&lt;div>
SPOILER ALERT: Today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>Wordle&lt;/strong> solution is shown at the bottom of the page!
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Lots of people have been complaining that &lt;strong>Wordle&lt;/strong> has become much harder since the &lt;strong>NY Times&lt;/strong> purchased the games and took control.
But it is a random list of words so you would expect easy and hard words every so often.
And while they have made some minor &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-archive-nyt-ban-offensive-guesses-streak-new-yor-1848525418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes&lt;/a> in the name of political correctness by removing possible &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;offensive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> words, wholesale changes this quickly are unlikely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Or so I thought&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While having a go at the daily puzzler over breakfast this morning I picked up my laptop (which I rarely use to play the game) as I was also checking some work stuff.
As it turned out out I still had the page open from the last time I played on my laptop and it was pointed at the original URL - &lt;a href="powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/&lt;/a> rather than the new NY Times address of &lt;a href="nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&lt;/a>.
I started my game without much thought and struggled to make it in 6.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later while discussing today&amp;rsquo;s word with my other half it soon became clear that we had solved different words!! What is going on?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it seems that the &lt;strong>NY Times have changed Wordle&lt;/strong> already, and maybe they have added back in some of the 10,000 or so other possible 5 letter words that weren&amp;rsquo;t on the original Wordle list, hence the feeling it is now more difficult as there are more obscure or less familiar words being used?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, here are the screenshots from a device where I had the old one still open in a chrome tab and was able to verify this. Let me know in the comments if you have also noticed something similar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, have you noticed the new logo? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about this new serif, sentence case font. Maybe I just don&amp;rsquo;t like changes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
